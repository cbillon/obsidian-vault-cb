====== Git Delta ======

Delta is a syntax-highlighting pager in your CLI for git, diff, and grep output. It has a rich feature set that gives you a much better Git CLI experience over the default:

  * Language syntax highlighting
  * Custom light and dark themes
  * Word-level diff highlighting
  * Side-by-side view with line wrapping
  * Line numbers
  * Integrates with Git
  * Navigation key bindings to move between files in large diffs
  * Improved merge conflict display

And much more

Delta works on a large variety of operating systemsâ€”check out [[https://dandavison.github.io/delta/installation.htm| Instalation Guide]]l to get started.

Afterwards, dive into [[https://dandavison.github.io/delta/introduction.html|the extensive official delta documentation]] to set up delta with Git and customize it to your style.
