  backup-begin domain [backupxml] [checkpointxml] [--reuse-external]

Begin a new backup job. If backupxml is omitted, this defaults  to a  full  backup  using a push model to filenames generated by lib‐virt; supplying XML allows fine-tuning such as requesting  an  incremental  backup  relative  to an earlier checkpoint, controlling which disks participate or which filenames are  involved,  or  re‐questing  the use of a pull model backup.  The backup-dumpxml command shows any resulting values assigned by libvirt. For more  information on backup XML,see:       
       https://libvirt.org/formatbackup.html

If --reuse-external is used it instructs libvirt to  reuse  temporary and output files provided by the user in backupxml.

If checkpointxml is specified, a second file with a top-level element of domaincheckpoint is used to create a  simultaneous  check point,for doing a later incremental backup relative to the time the backup was created. See checkpoint-create for more details  on checkpoints.

This  command returns as soon as possible, and the backup job runs in the background; the progress of a  push  model  backup  can  be checked with domjobinfo or by waiting for an event with event (the progress of a pull model backup is under the control  of  whatever third  party  connects  to  the NBD export). The job is ended with
