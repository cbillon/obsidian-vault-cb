====== Installation ASDF ======

[[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-asdf-to-manage-multiple-programming-language-runtime-versions-on-ubuntu-22-04]]

asdf relies on the installation of a core that, alone, does not have functionality. The asdf core relies on separate plugins that are specific to a given programming language or program. Most commonly, it is used to install and manage multiple versions of a given programming language. Itâ€™s recommended that you download the asdf core with git, which comes installed with Ubuntu 22.04. To get the latest version of asdf, clone the latest branch from the asdf repository:

  git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf 
  
asdf requires a unique installation depending on the combination of shell type and method it was downloaded. By default, Ubuntu uses Bash for its shell, which uses the ~/.bashrc file for configuration and customization. To enable the usage of the asdf command, you will have to add the following line:

  echo ". $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
  
Next, make sure your changes are applied to your current session:

  source ~/.bashrc
