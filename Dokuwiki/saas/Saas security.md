===== What is a SaaS? =====

I'm glad you asked, in short Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud-based software model that delivers applications to users through your browser.

The software and infrastructure are managed by the SaaS provider, and users can access the service on-demand, typically under a subscription or pay-as-you-use pricing model

All business needs can be very different and the curated list of features can vary from one organization to the next.

Your SaaS application can integrate open-source software to enhance its capabilities and provide exceptional value to your users.
