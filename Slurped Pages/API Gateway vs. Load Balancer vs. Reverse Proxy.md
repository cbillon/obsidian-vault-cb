title: API Gateway vs. Load Balancer vs. Reverse Proxy
---

API Gateways, Reverse Proxy Servers, and Load Balancers are essential components in modern software architecture. Each serves a specific role that enhances web application performance, security, and scalability. Yet, we often need clarification about the roles of those services.

Here are the main characteristics:

- **API Gateway** sits between a client and a group of backend services. It performs the function of a reverse proxy by accepting all application programming interface (API) calls, aggregating the different services needed to fulfill them, and returning the right outcome. **User authentication, rate limits, and statistics** are typical duties that API gateways take care of on behalf of a system of API services. Also, the API gateway can handle faults (circuit breaker) and log and monitor.
    
    Find more details about the API Gateway at the link below.
    

- **Load Balancer** is a service that distributes incoming traffic across many servers or resources. Usually, we have two or more web servers on the backend, and it **distributes network traffic between them**. Its primary purpose is to use resources optimally. A more equal task allocation and increased capacity can enhance the system's responsiveness and reliability. There are three high-level load balancers: hardware-based, cloud-based, and software-based.
    
- **Reverse Proxy** server resides in front of backend servers and transfers client requests to these servers. Reverse proxies are typically used to increase security, speed, and dependability. A reverse proxy receives a request from a client, forwards it to another server, and then returns it to the client, giving the impression that the first proxy server handled the request. These proxies ensure that users don't access the origin server directly, giving the web server anonymity. They are usually used for Load balancing, where we need to deal with incoming traffic flow so that we may distribute that traffic between multiple backend servers or use them for caching.
    

So, the main thing that differs these two is that an **API Gateway is focused on routing requests** to the appropriate service and handles requests for APIs, while a **Load Balancer is focused on distributing requests evenly** between a group of servers and handles requests that are sent to a single IP address, which works at protocol or socket level (TCP, HTTP).

Some examples of **API Gateways** are:

- [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
    
- [Ocelot](https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot)
    
- [Tyk](https://tyk.io/)
    
- [Apache APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org/)
    

**Load Balancers** are:

- [Azure Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview)
    
- [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/)
    
- [Seesaw](https://github.com/google/seesaw)
    

An example of **reverse proxy** services are:

- [Apache Proxy](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html)
    
- [YARP](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/)
    
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
    
- [IIS](https://www.iis.net/) with additional modules (Url Rewrite).

API Gateway vs. Load Balancer vs. Reverse Proxy

If you're building a .NET application using microservice architecture and considering a reverse proxy, **YARP** (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) and **Ocelot** are two popular options. They act as an intermediary server, receiving client requests and forwarding them to the appropriate backend service.

This offers several benefits, including:

- **Load balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple backend servers for improved performance and scalability.
    
- **Security:** Shield backend servers from direct exposure to the internet, enhancing security.
    
- **Request manipulation:** Modify or enrich requests before sending them to the backend.
    

[YARP](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/) is a relatively new open-source project from Microsoft. The main feature that sets YARP apart from the competition is its ease of customization and adjustment to fit the unique requirements of any deployment situation. It boasts a robust feature set, including:

- **Load balancing:** Implements various load-balancing algorithms for efficient traffic distribution.
    
- **Health checks:** Monitors backend service health and only routes requests to healthy instances.
    
- **Session affinity:** Maintains user sessions with specific backend services for a seamless user experience.
    
- **Middleware integration:** Works seamlessly with ASP.NET Core middleware for customizing request and response handling.
    
- **Performance-oriented**: Built on the high-performance, scalable ASP.NET Core platform, YARP is optimized for speed and low memory consumption, making it ideal for high-throughput scenarios.

Distributing workloads among various computing resources is known as load balancing. The goals of load balancing are to maximize throughput, decrease reaction time, and prevent overloading of any particular resource. Distributing a task among redundant computing resources can also increase availability.

Azure provides various load balancing servicesâ€”[Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview), [Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview), [Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview), and [Traffic Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview)â€”to distribute workloads across multiple computing resources.

Here is **the decision tree** for load balancing in Azure, which depends on multiple factors, such as traffic type (web app, private vs public app), global vs regional, availability, cost, and more.
