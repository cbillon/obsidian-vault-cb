title: "Automating GitHub Code Check-Ins: A Bash Script Approach"
---

I have a bad habit of not checking in my code. Because of this, Iâ€™ve ended up with code scattered across multiple machines over the years. A few years back, I started using GitHub, but if Iâ€™m being honest, only about half of my code actually makes it there. This year, I want that to change.

This morning, while creating a new directory structure for my Ethical Hacking Robot project, I realized that the code wasnâ€™t checked in anywhere. As I designed a bash script to set up the directory structure, it seemed like the perfect time to fix this bad habit. I decided to create two additional scriptsâ€”one to link a project to a GitHub repository and another to handle syncing and pushing code automatically. After testing, both scripts worked well, and theyâ€™ve already improved my workflow.

## [](https://dev.to/sebos/automating-github-code-check-ins-a-bash-script-approach-26if#linking-a-project-to-a-github-repository)Linking a Project to a GitHub Repository

To streamline the process, I created a script that links a new project to a GitHub repository as the project directories are being set up. This script relies on a configuration file, `setup_config.sh`, which includes:

- **USERNAME** â€“ The local Linux system username
- **GITHUB_REPO** â€“ The GitHub repository URL
- **GIT_USER_NAME** â€“ The GitHub account name
- **GIT_USER_EMAIL** â€“ The email associated with the GitHub account
- **GITHUB_API_TOKEN** â€“ A GitHub API token for authentication

Since storing sensitive credentials directly in the config file is a bad practice, the API token isnâ€™t hardcoded. Instead, itâ€™s retrieved at runtime from a secure, restricted file (`/home/richard/.github_token`). The script structure is straightforward:  

```
#!/bin/bash

# Load configuration variables
source setup_config.sh  # User and GitHub setup

LOGFILE="/home/$USERNAME/setup.log"
exec > >(tee -a "$LOGFILE") 2>&1

# Creates project users and files
.
.
.
# Call GitHub setup script
bash setup_github.sh "$USERNAME" "$GITHUB_REPO" "$GIT_USER_NAME" "$GIT_USER_EMAIL" "$GITHUB_API_TOKEN"
```

 

## [](https://dev.to/sebos/automating-github-code-check-ins-a-bash-script-approach-26if#setting-up-github-authentication)Setting Up GitHub Authentication

Once the script is executed, it sets up SSH authentication for GitHub access. It generates an SSH key for the project user and updates the `.ssh/config` file to streamline authentication:  

```
sudo -u $USERNAME ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "$USERNAME@$(hostname)" -f $USER_HOME/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""

echo "Host github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    StrictHostKeyChecking no" | sudo -u $USERNAME tee $USER_HOME/.ssh/config > /dev/null
```

 

Next, it uses `curl` and the GitHub API token to register the SSH key with GitHub:  

```
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
     --data "{\"title\":\"$USERNAME@$(hostname)\", \"key\":\"$SSH_KEY_CONTENT\"}" \
     https://api.github.com/user/keys
```

 

With authentication in place, the script configures Git global settings and either clones the repository or pulls the latest updates if it already exists:  

```
sudo -u $USERNAME git config --global user.name "$GIT_USER_NAME"
sudo -u $USERNAME git config --global user.email "$GIT_USER_EMAIL"

if [ -d "$USER_HOME/github/.git" ]; then
    echo "âœ… Repository already exists. Pulling latest updates..."
    sudo -u $USERNAME git -C $USER_HOME/github pull origin main
else
    echo "ðŸ”¹ Cloning GitHub repository..."
    sudo -u $USERNAME git clone "$GITHUB_REPO" "$USER_HOME/github"
fi
```

 

Since the project script creates a new Linux user to run the project under, `sudo` is necessary throughout this process.

## [](https://dev.to/sebos/automating-github-code-check-ins-a-bash-script-approach-26if#checking-in-code)Checking In Code

Now that the project is linked to a repository, the next step is automating code check-ins. My repository stores development, staging, and production code. The check-in script specifically syncs development code with GitHub.

First, it defines the source and destination directories:  

```
SRC_ROS2="/home/ros2_dev/ros2_ws/src/"
SRC_NON_ROS="/home/ros2_dev/non_ros_code/"
DEST_GITHUB="/home/ros2_dev/github/dev/"
```

 

Then, `rsync` is used to sync the development directory with the local Git repository while excluding unnecessary build files:  

```
rsync -av --exclude='build/' --exclude='install/' --exclude='log/' "$SRC_ROS2" "$DEST_GITHUB/src/"

# Sync non-ROS2 code
rsync -av "$SRC_NON_ROS" "$DEST_GITHUB/non_ros_code/"
```

 

Finally, the script stages, commits, and pushes the code to GitHub:  

```
git add dev/
git commit -m "Backup dev workspace to GitHub on $(date)"
git push origin main
```

While this setup is a significant improvement, itâ€™s far from perfect. Right now, there are hardcoded paths everywhere, and the process isnâ€™t fully automated. These are the next areas Iâ€™ll be addressing.
