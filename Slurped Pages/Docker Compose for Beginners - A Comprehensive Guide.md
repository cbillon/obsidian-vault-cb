## Best Practices:

## 1)Use environment variables in your YAML file to make it more dynamic and flexible

Description: Use `${PORT}` to refer to the port number that is set in an environment variable named **PORT**. You can also use `.env` files to store your environment variables in a separate file.

## 2)Use `.env` files to store environment variables that you don't want to expose

Description: Create a `.env` file in the same directory as your `compose.yaml` file and write `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret` in it. Then, you can reference this variable in your `docker-compose.yml` file as `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}.`

## 3)Use volumes to persist data across container restarts or share data between containers

Description: Use volumes to store the database data or the web server configuration. You can define named volumes in the top-level volumes section of your YAML file and then reference them in your services. You can also use bind mounts to mount a directory or a file from your host system into your containers.

## 4)Use networks to isolate and connect your services

Description: Use networks to restrict the communication between your services or to enable communication with external services. You can define custom networks in the top-level networks section of your YAML file and then reference them in your services. You can also use the default network that is created by Docker Compose for your application.

## 5)Use labels to add metadata to your containers, networks, and volumes

Description: Use labels to identify the owner, purpose, or version of your resources. You can define labels in the labels section of your YAML file and then use them to filter or group your resources.

## 6)Use .gitignore files to exclude files or directories that you don’t want to commit

Description: Create a `.gitignore` file in the same directory as your `compose.yaml` file and write `.env` and `db-data/*` in it. Then, these files or directories will not be tracked by Git.

## 7)Use health checks to monitor the status of your services

Description: Use health checks to determine if a service is ready, healthy, or unhealthy. You can define health checks in the health check section of your YAML file and then use them to control the startup order, restart policy, or scaling behavior of your services.
