title: How to learn API?
---

Our daily work as software engineers involves creating or utilizing these APIs. Creating **well-designed REST APIs is crucial**‚Äînot only should they be easy to work with and concise, but they should also be well-designed against misuse to prevent future issues.

In this issue, we explore the art of **API design through a curated selection of resources**, including insightful books, articles, and real-world examples from industry leaders like Stripe and Slack. We'll learn about the proper use of HTTP methods, RESTful URI structures, effective error handling, caching strategies, and the importance of thorough API documentation.

Additionally, we'll present **common API anti-patterns** that often lead to bigger problems later.

So, let‚Äôs dive in.

_Great news for all hobbyists, students, content creators, and open-source contributors! Now web, game, and .NET developers can use WebStorm and Rider for free for learning and honing their skills, developing open-source projects, creating content, and developing as a hobby._

APIs are one of the first things software engineers should learn, much before other, more complex things, such as distributed systems, cloud computing, and others. They are the basis of all development today, and they will help you understand how software systems work and how to use proper programming languages and frameworks.

Whether you're a beginner¬†or an experienced developer looking to learn about APIs, this API learning roadmap will help you understand the key concepts and technologies.

Before diving deep into API development, it's crucial to understand the fundamentals. This section covers the basic building blocks that form the foundation of API knowledge, from core protocols to different APIs used in modern software development.

- **Basics**: Learn about [HTTP protocol](https://newsletter.techworld-with-milan.com/p/understanding-rest-headers), DNS, URLs, and more.
    
- **API Definition**: An API is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. It specifies how software components should interact.
    
- **API Types**:
    
    - **üåê Public APIs**: Open for use by external developers (e.g., Twitter API)
        
    - **üîí Private APIs**: Used internally within an organization
        
    - **üîë Partner APIs**: Shared with specific business partners
        
    - **üß© Composite APIs**: Combine multiple data or service APIs
        

Understanding different API architectural styles is essential, as each serves specific use cases and has advantages and trade-offs. These architectures form the core of your API's structure and client interaction.

- **[REST (Representational State Transfer)](https://newsletter.techworld-with-milan.com/p/understanding-rest-headers):** A widely used architectural style for web APIs
    
- **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs that allows clients to request specific data
    
- **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**: A protocol for exchanging structured data
    
- **gRPC**: A high-performance, open-source framework developed by Google
    
- **WebSockets**: Enables full-duplex, real-time communication between client and server
    
- **Webhook**: Allows real-time notifications and event-driven architecture

And what are the fundamental differences between them:

Security is one of the most critical parts of API development. This section covers essential security concepts and best practices that protect your API from unauthorized access and potential threats while ensuring secure data transmission.

- **Authentication**: Basic, OAuth 2.0, JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
    
- **Authorization**: Controlling access rights to resources
    
- **Rate Limiting**: Preventing abuse by limiting the number of requests
    
- **Encryption**: Protecting data in transit using HTTPS
    
- **Best practices**: [OWASP Top 10 Security Risks](https://newsletter.techworld-with-milan.com/p/what-are-the-main-api-architecture)

Good API design differentiates between an API developers love to use and one they avoid. These best practices have evolved from years of industry experience and help create intuitive, efficient, and maintainable APIs.

- **RESTful conventions**: Using HTTP methods correctly, proper resource naming
    
- **Versioning**: URI versioning (e.g., /v1/users), Query parameter versioning (e.g., /users?version=1), Header versioning (e.g., Accept: application/vnd.company.v1+json).
    
- **Pagination**: Efficiently handling large datasets
    
- **Error Handling**: Proper use of HTTP status codes and informative error messages
    
    - [RFC 7807 - Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) (outdated)
        
    - [RFC 9457 - Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457.html) (new version)

API Roadmap

Most of our daily work as software engineers utilizes or creates REST APIs. APIs are the standard method of communication between systems. Therefore, building REST APIs properly is crucial to avoid future issues. A well-defined API should be easy to work with, concise, and hard to misuse.

There are design patterns in software design, which are good practices, but we also have anti-patterns. These anti-patterns often seem like good ideas initially but can lead to different problems over time.

This holds not only for general software design but also in the API world.

Here are some common API anti-patterns we can see in the wild:

If we don't align with RESTful design principles, this can lead us to a confusing and unpredictable API.

Here are some examples of such problems:

- Using POST for everything instead of appropriate GET, PUT, and DELETE methods
    
    - ‚ùå `POST /updateUser`
        
    - ‚úÖ `PUT /users/{id}`
        
- Focusing on actions rather than resources
    
    - ‚ùå `GET /getLatestCheckout`
        
    - ‚úÖ `GET /checkouts/latest`
        

There could be multiple issues in this area:

- Inconsistent resource naming (mixing singular/plural)
    
    - ‚ùå `/user/{id}` vs `/companies`
        
    - ‚úÖ `/users/{id}` and `/companies`
        
- Mixing verbs and nouns
    
    - ‚ùå `/createPost` and `/comments`
        
    - ‚úÖ `/posts` and `/comments`
        

The best practice is to:

- Use consistent plural nouns for collections
    
- Keep URLs resource-focused, not action-focused
    
- Maintain consistent casing (preferably kebab-case)
    

An example could be generic error messages, such as always returning "An error occurred" instead of "Invalid email format."

Another example is using incorrect or non-standard status codes, such as Returning 200 OK for all responses, even when an error occurs. We need to know some major response status codes, but we can also create our own.

Some common mistakes are:

- Generic error messages
    
    - ‚ùå "An error occurred"
        
    - ‚úÖ "Invalid email format: user@domain missing top-level domain"
        
- Incorrect HTTP status codes
    
    - ‚ùå Using 200 OK for errors
        
    - ‚úÖ Using appropriate codes (400 for client errors, 500 for server errors)
        

Best practices are:

- Use specific, actionable error messages
    
- Include error codes and documentation references
    
- Follow HTTP status code conventions:
    
    - 2xx for success
        
    - 4xx for client errors
        
    - 5xx for server errors
        

We usually don't use any caching mechanism with our REST APIs, even though we have many options. This can degrade application performance.

For example, we can use HTTP caching headers like ETag, Cache-Control, and Last-Modified to control how responses are cached by clients, which will increase application stability and performance.

Proper documentation can help us understand how to interact with our APIs. We want to invest time in creating proper documentation covering all API aspects, including endpoints, parameters, data models, error codes, and examples of typical requests and responses. We can use tools like Swagger (OpenAPI Specification) to generate interactive documentation.

Also, today, we can use **AI tools to generate documentation from your API's codebase or annotations**.
