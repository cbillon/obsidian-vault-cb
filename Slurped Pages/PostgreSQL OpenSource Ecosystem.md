_What are the possibilities for industrializing Open Source assets in the PostgreSQL ecosystem?_

_How to limit technical debt or dependency on a single supplier?_

The **PostgreSQL OpenSource Ecosystem** project aims to help you answer these questions by referencing the extensions and tools of the ecosystem.

The project is **OpenSource** and still under construction.

It will continue to be structured in the coming weeks.
