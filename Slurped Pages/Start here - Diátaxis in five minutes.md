You don’t need to read everything on this website to make sense of Diátaxis, or to start using it in practice. In fact I recommend that you don’t. **The best way to get started with Diátaxis is by applying it** - to something, however small.

Read this page for a brief primer. Each section contains links to more in-depth material; refer to that when you need it - when you’re actually at work, or reflecting on the documentation problems you have encountered.

## The four kinds of documentation[¶](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/#the-four-kinds-of-documentation "Link to this heading")

The core idea of Diátaxis is that there are fundamentally four identifiable kinds of documentation, that respond to four different needs. The four kinds are: _tutorials_, _how-to guides_, _reference_ and _explanation_. Each has a different purpose, and needs to be written in a different way.

### Tutorials[¶](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/#tutorials "Link to this heading")

**A tutorial is a lesson**, that takes a student by the hand through a learning experience. A tutorial is always _practical_: the user _does_ something, under the guidance of an instructor. A tutorial is designed around an encounter that the learner can make sense of, in which the instructor is responsible for the learner’s safety and success.

A driving lesson is a good example of a tutorial. The purpose of the lesson is to develop skills and confidence in the student, not to get from A to B. A software example could be: _Let’s create a simple game in Python_.

_The user will learn through what they do_ - not because someone has tried to teach them.

In documentation, the special difficulty is that the instructor is condemned to be absent, and is not there to monitor the learner and correct their mistakes. The instructor must somehow find a way to be present through written instruction alone.

### How-to guides[¶](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/#how-to-guides "Link to this heading")

**A how-to guide addresses a real-world goal or problem**, by providing practical directions to help the user who is in that situation.

A how-to guide always addresses an already-competent user, who is expected to be able to use the guide to help them get their work done. In contrast to a tutorial, a how-to guide is concerned with _work_ rather than _study_.

A how-to guide might be: _How to store cellulose nitrate film_ (in motion picture photography) or _How to configure frame profiling_ (in software). Or even: _Troubleshooting deployment problems_.

### Reference[¶](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/#reference "Link to this heading")

**Reference guides contain the technical description** - facts - that a user needs in order to do things correctly: accurate, complete, reliable information, free of distraction and interpretation. They contain _propositional or theoretical knowledge_, not guides to action.

Like a how-to guide, reference documentation serves the user who is at _work_, and it’s up to the user to be sufficiently competent to interpret and use it correctly.

_Reference material is neutral._ It is not concerned with what the user is doing. A marine chart could be used by a ship’s navigator to plot a course, but equally well by a prosecuting magistrate in a legal case.

Where possible, the architecture of reference documentation should reflect the structure or architecture of the thing it’s describing - just like a map does. If a method is part of a class that belongs to a certain module, then we should expect to see the same relationship in the documentation too.

### Explanation[¶](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/#explanation "Link to this heading")

**Explanatory guides provide context and background.** They serve the need to understand and put things in a bigger picture. Explanation joins things together, and helps answer the question _why?_

Explanation often needs to circle around its subject, and approach it from different directions. It can contain opinions and take perspectives.

Like reference, explanation belongs to the realm of propositional knowledge rather than action. However its purpose is to serve the user’s study - as tutorials do - and not their work.

Often, writers of tutorials who are anxious that their students should _know_ things overload their tutorials with distracting and unhelpful explanation. It would be much more useful to give the learner the most minimal explanation (“Here, we use HTTPS because it’s safer”) and then link to an in-depth article (_Secure communication using HTTPS encryption_) for when the user is ready for it.

## The Diátaxis map[¶](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/#the-diataxis-map "Link to this heading")

The four kinds of documentation and the relationships between them can be summarised in the Diátaxis map.

Diátaxis is not just a list of four different things, but a conceptual arrangement of them. It shows how the four kinds of documentation are related to each other, and distinct from each other.

Crossing or blurring the boundaries described in the map is at the heart of a vast number of problems in documentation.

## The Diátaxis compass[¶](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/#the-diataxis-compass "Link to this heading")

As you can see from the map:

- tutorials and how-to guides are concerned with what the user _does_ (**action**)
    
- reference and explanation are about what the user _knows_ (**cognition**)
    

On the other hand:

- tutorials and explanation serve the _acquistion_ of skill (the user’s **study**)
    
- how-to guides and reference serve the _application_ of skill (the user’s **work**)
    

But a map doesn’t tell you want to _do_ - it’s reference. To guide your action you need a different sort of tool, in this case, a kind of Diátaxis compass.

The compass is useful in two different ways.

When creating documentation, it helps clarify your own intentions, and helps make sure you’re actually doing what you think you’re doing.

When looking at documentation, it helps understand what’s going on in it, and makes problems stand out.

The compass is not nearly as eye-catching as the map, but when you’re at work puzzling over a documentation problem it’s what will help you move forward.

  
|If the content…|…and serves the user’s…|…then it must belong to…|
|---|---|---|
|informs action|acquisition of skill|a tutorial|
|informs action|application of skill|a how-to guide|
|informs cognition|application of skill|reference|
|informs cognition|acquisition of skill|explanation|

## Working[¶](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/#working "Link to this heading")

There is a very simple workflow for Diátaxis.

1. Consider what you see in the documentation, in front of you right now (which might be literally nothing, if you haven’t started yet).
    
2. Ask: _is there any way in which it could be improved?_
    
3. Decide on _one_ thing you could do to it right now, however small, that would improve it.
    
4. Do that thing.
    

And then repeat.

That’s it.

## Do what you like[¶](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/#do-what-you-like "Link to this heading")

You can do what you like with Diátaxis. You don’t have to believe in it and there is no exam. It is a wholly pragmatic approach. I think it’s _true_, but what matters is that it actually helps people create better documentation. If you find one idea or insight in it that seems to be worthwhile, help yourself to that.

There is an extensively elaborated theory around Diátaxis, but you don’t need to subscribe to it, or even read about it. Diátaxis doesn’t require a commitment to pursue it to a final end.

You can do just one thing, right now, and even if you do nothing else ever after, you will at least have made that one improvement. (In practice what you will find is that each thing you do will give you a clue as to the next thing to do - you only need to keep doing them.)

## Get started[¶](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/#get-started "Link to this heading")

At this point, you have read everything you need to get started with Diátaxis.

You can read more if you want, and eventually you probably should, but _you will get the most value from the guidance in this website when you turn to it with a problem or a question_. That’s when it comes alive.
